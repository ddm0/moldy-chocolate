# moldy-chocolate
A bot that optimally plays the moldy chocolate game.
Two players take turns by breaking an mxn chocolate bar, which has one spoiled 1-by-1 square. Each break must be a single straight line cutting all the way across the bar along the boundaries between the squares. After each break, the player who broke the bar last eats the piece that does not contain the spoiled corner. The player left with the spoiled square loses the game.
